**This project is still a work in progress but feel free to look around :D**

On course is a course platform made with modern react and Nextjs. It has a student mode in which you can watch courses and make assignments, and a teacher mode in which you can upload your own courses

To test it locally run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
